# Higher Lower Dice - Game Guide

## How to Play

Higher Lower Dice is a fast-paced, simultaneous multiplayer betting game where you and your opponent predict whether the next dice roll will be higher or lower than the current one.

## Getting Started

### Setting Up a Game

1. **Host a Game**
   - Tap "HOST GAME" on the home screen
   - You'll receive a 6-digit room code
   - Share this code with your opponent

2. **Join a Game**
   - Enter the 6-digit room code on the home screen
   - Tap "JOIN GAME"
   - Wait for the host to start

3. **Starting the Game**
   - Once both players are connected, a 3-second countdown begins
   - The game starts automatically after the countdown

## Gameplay Overview

### The Basics

- **Starting Points**: Both players begin with 100 points
- **Total Rounds**: 20 rounds per game
- **Betting Time**: 10 seconds per round (5 seconds on rush rounds)
- **Goal**: Accumulate the most points or eliminate your opponent

### How Each Round Works

1. **Current Dice Display**
   - A dice value (1-6) is shown in the center
   - This is the reference point for your prediction

2. **Betting Phase (10 seconds)**
   - Choose your bet amount:
     - **10 points** - Small, safe bet
     - **25 points** - Medium bet
     - **50%** - Half your current points
     - **ALL IN** - Bet everything you have
   - Make your prediction:
     - **Normal Mode** (dice = 2, 3, 4, or 5):
       - **HIGHER** - Next dice will be greater than current
       - **LOWER** - Next dice will be less than current
     - **Edge Case Mode** (dice = 1 or 6):
       - **4 OR HIGHER** - Next dice will be 4, 5, or 6 (50% chance)
       - **3 OR LOWER** - Next dice will be 1, 2, or 3 (50% chance)
   - Lock in your bet before time runs out

3. **Dice Roll**
   - A new dice value is rolled (same for both players)
   - Results are calculated simultaneously

4. **Results Display**
   - See if you won, lost, or pushed
   - View points gained/lost
   - Check for any bonuses earned
   - Results display for 4 seconds

5. **Next Round**
   - After a brief pause (5 seconds total), the next round begins
   - The new dice value becomes the current dice
   - Process repeats

## Scoring System

### Basic Points

- **Correct Prediction**: Gain points equal to your bet
  - Example: Bet 25 points, predict HIGHER correctly → +25 points

- **Wrong Prediction**: Lose points equal to your bet
  - Example: Bet 25 points, predict HIGHER incorrectly → -25 points

- **Push (Same Number)**: No points gained or lost
  - Your bet is returned, but you don't win or lose
  - Example: Current dice is 4, new dice is 4 → Push
  - **Note**: Push only applies in Normal Mode (dice 2-5). In Edge Case Mode (dice 1 or 6), there are no pushes - outcomes are always win or loss

### Special Bonuses

1. **Mirror Bonus (+10 points)**
   - Triggered when both players:
     - Bet the same direction (both HIGHER or both LOWER)
     - Both win their predictions
   - Each player receives +10 bonus points
   - Example: Both bet HIGHER, both win → Each gets +10 bonus

2. **Contrarian Bonus (+5 points)**
   - Triggered when:
     - You win your prediction
     - Your opponent loses their prediction
   - You receive +5 bonus points
   - Example: You bet HIGHER and win, opponent bet LOWER and lost → You get +5 bonus

3. **Speed Bonus (+2 points)**
   - Awarded to the player who locks in their bet first
   - Encourages quick decision-making
   - Example: You bet before your opponent → +2 bonus points

### Penalties

- **No Bet Submitted**: -10 points
  - If you don't lock in a bet before time expires
  - Your opponent still gets their normal result

## Rush Rounds

Every 5th round (rounds 5, 10, 15, 20) is a **Rush Round**:

- **Timer**: Reduced to 5 seconds (instead of 10)
- **Visual Indicator**: Timer appears larger and more intense
- **Strategy**: Requires faster decision-making
- **Points**: Same scoring rules apply

## Win Conditions

The game ends immediately when any of these conditions are met:

1. **Points Threshold**
   - First player to reach **300 points** wins instantly
   - Game ends immediately, no need to complete all rounds

2. **Elimination**
   - If a player reaches **0 points** (or below), they lose
   - The other player wins instantly

3. **Round Completion**

   - If tied, the game ends in a draw

## Strategy Tips

### Betting Strategy

1. **Start Conservative**
   - Early rounds: Use smaller bets (10-25 points)
   - Build your point total before taking risks

2. **Read the Odds**
   - **Dice is 1 or 6** (Edge Case): Both options are 50/50:
     - **4 OR HIGHER**: 50% chance (3 out of 6: rolls 4, 5, or 6)
     - **3 OR LOWER**: 50% chance (3 out of 6: rolls 1, 2, or 3)
     - **No push** - always win or lose
   - **Dice is 2**: HIGHER more likely (4/6), LOWER less likely (1/6)
   - **Dice is 3 or 4**: Most balanced between HIGHER and LOWER
   - **Dice is 5**: LOWER more likely (4/6), HIGHER less likely (1/6)

3. **Watch Your Opponent**
   - If opponent bets high amount, they're confident
   - Consider betting opposite direction for contrarian bonus
   - Or match their bet for mirror bonus potential

4. **Manage Your Points**
   - Don't go ALL IN unless you're behind
   - Keep enough points to recover from losses
   - 50% bets are good middle ground

5. **Rush Round Strategy**
   - Have a quick decision ready
   - Don't overthink - trust your instincts
   - Smaller bets might be safer with less time

### Advanced Tactics

1. **Psychological Warfare**
   - Betting large amounts can intimidate opponents
   - Quick bets might pressure opponent to rush
   - Changing bet amounts can confuse opponent

2. **Bonus Hunting**
   - Try to predict opponent's bet direction
   - Match for mirror bonus (if confident)
   - Bet opposite for contrarian bonus (if confident)

3. **Comeback Strategy**
   - If behind, take calculated risks
   - ALL IN can turn the game around
   - But be careful - one wrong bet can end the game

4. **Defensive Play**
   - If ahead, use smaller bets
   - Protect your lead
   - Let opponent take risks

## Understanding Probabilities

### Normal Mode (Dice = 2, 3, 4, or 5)

When current dice is:
- **2**: HIGHER = 67% chance (4/6), LOWER = 17% chance (1/6), PUSH = 17% (1/6)
- **3**: HIGHER = 50% chance (3/6), LOWER = 33% chance (2/6), PUSH = 17% (1/6)
- **4**: HIGHER = 33% chance (2/6), LOWER = 50% chance (3/6), PUSH = 17% (1/6)
- **5**: HIGHER = 17% chance (1/6), LOWER = 67% chance (4/6), PUSH = 17% (1/6)

### Edge Case Mode (Dice = 1 or 6)

When current dice is **1** or **6**:
- **4 OR HIGHER**: 50% chance (3/6 - rolls 4, 5, or 6 win)
- **3 OR LOWER**: 50% chance (3/6 - rolls 1, 2, or 3 win)
- **No push possible** - outcomes are always win or loss
- Perfect 50/50 odds make these rounds pure chance

### Push Probability

- In Normal Mode: 16.7% chance (1/6) that new dice equals current dice
- Push returns your bet but gives no points
- In Edge Case Mode: No pushes - always win or lose

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Edge Case Bet
- Current dice: **1** (Edge Case Mode)
- Your bet: 25 points on **4 OR HIGHER**
- New dice: **5**
- Result: **WIN** → +25 points (5 is in range 4-6)

### Scenario 2: Risky Bet
- Current dice: **4**
- Your bet: 50 points on HIGHER
- New dice: **2**
- Result: **LOSS** → -50 points

### Scenario 3: Push
- Current dice: **3** (Normal Mode)
- Your bet: 30 points on HIGHER
- New dice: **3**
- Result: **PUSH** → 0 points (bet returned)

### Scenario 3b: Edge Case - No Push
- Current dice: **6** (Edge Case Mode)
- Your bet: 30 points on **3 OR LOWER**
- New dice: **6**
- Result: **LOSS** → -30 points (6 is not in range 1-3, no push possible)

### Scenario 4: Mirror Bonus
- Current dice: **2**
- You bet: 20 points on HIGHER

## Tips for Success

1. **Stay Calm Under Pressure**
   - Timer creates urgency, but don't panic
   - Quick decisions are better than rushed mistakes

2. **Track Your Points**
   - Know how much you have at all times
   - Don't bet more than you can afford to lose

3. **Learn Opponent Patterns**
   - Do they bet conservatively or aggressively?
   - Do they bet quickly or wait until the last second?
   - Adjust your strategy accordingly

4. **Timing Matters**
   - Betting first gives speed bonus (+2 points)
   - But waiting lets you see opponent's bet status
   - Find your balance

5. **Endgame Strategy**
   - If close to 300 points, go for it
   - If opponent is close, take bigger risks to catch up
   - If far behind, ALL IN might be your only chance

## Troubleshooting

### Can't See Opponent's Bet
- Opponent's bet amount is hidden until both players lock in
- You'll see "Locked In" status but not the amount
- This prevents copying opponent's strategy

### Timer Running Out
- If timer expires, you automatically lose 10 points
- Always try to lock in a bet, even if small

### Connection Issues
- If opponent disconnects, game ends
- You win by default
- Return to home screen to start a new game

### Game Stuck
- If game seems frozen, try leaving and rejoining
- Make sure both players are connected
- Check your internet connection

## Game Etiquette

1. **Fair Play**
   - Don't disconnect intentionally
   - Don't use multiple devices to gain advantage
   - Play honestly and have fun

2. **Respect Opponent**
   - Don't spam or abuse the system
   - Accept wins and losses gracefully
   - Rematch if you want another game

3. **Communication**
   - Room codes are case-sensitive
   - Share codes clearly
   - Double-check codes before joining
